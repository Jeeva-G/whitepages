h2. Description

The Whitepages Gem provides a library for consuming the web services provided by <a href="http://www.whitepages.com">Whitepages</a>. More information on the Developer API may be found <a href="http://developer.whitepages.com/">here</a>. This API may be used to lookup people by name as well as reverse lookups based on phone number or address.

There are a couple of limitations to consider (refer to the Whitepages website for any changes):

* Maximum of 1,500 calls per day per API key
* Throttle set at 2 searches per second per API key

h2. Example

<pre>
	<code>
		require 'rubygems'
		require 'whitepages'
		
		API_KEY = "api_key_here"
		
		wp = Whitepages.new(API_KEY)

		#Query a person based on name, where state is optional
		#This will return multiple listings if they exist
		#More options are available here: 
		#http://developer.whitepages.com/docs/Methods/find_person
		data = wp.find_person({ "lastname" => "Smith",

		#Query an entry based on phone, where state is optional
